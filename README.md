# Power Calculation Program

This C program calculates the power of a number using a simple algorithm. It prompts the user to enter a number and its power, then computes the result and displays it.

## Usage

1. **Compile**: To compile the program, use any C compiler. For example, with GCC:

    ```bash
    gcc power_calculation.c -o power_calculation
    ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled binary:

    ```bash
    ./power_calculation
    ```

3. **Input**: Enter the number and its power as prompted.

4. **Output**: The program will display the result of the number raised to the power.

## Example

Enter a Number : 2

Enter Power of the Number : 3

2^3

3 power of 2 = 8
